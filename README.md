# Do Code - The App for Coders

Do Code is an app made by coders for coders, aimed at providing a one-stop-shop for all things related to competitive programming, technical news, and job alerts. The app is built using the MVVM architecture, with Firebase for authentication and Cloud Firestore for database storage.

## Features

### Do Code comes with the following features:

**Upcoming contests**: Get notified about all the upcoming competitive programming contests. This feature helps you stay on top of your game and never miss a contest.
**Latest technical news**: Stay updated on the latest technical news from around the world. This feature is perfect for anyone who wants to stay up-to-date with the latest trends and developments in the world of technology.
**Job alerts**: Get notified about the latest job openings in the tech industry. This feature is perfect for job seekers who want to stay informed about the latest job opportunities.
**Resource section**: This section allows users to submit a resource they found useful and simultaneously view resources uploaded by other users. It's a great way to discover new resources and share knowledge with the community.
Architecture

### The app is built using the `MVVM architecture, which stands for Model-View-ViewModel`. This architecture is designed to separate the User Interface from the Business Logic and Data Storage layers, making the app more modular and easier to maintain.

## Authentication

Do Code uses `Firebase` for authentication. Firebase provides a secure and reliable authentication system that is easy to use and integrates seamlessly with the app.

## Database

Do Code uses Cloud Firestore for database storage. `Cloud Firestore` is a scalable and flexible `NoSQL database` that can handle large amounts of data with ease. It provides real-time data synchronization and offline data access, which makes the app more responsive and reliable.

## Hackathon

Our App won `4th place in the VIIT ACM ENIGMA Hackathon`. The hackathon was a great opportunity for our team to showcase our skills and build something that would be useful for the coding community. We are grateful for the recognition and support we received during the hackathon, and we are excited to continue developing and improving Do Code.
